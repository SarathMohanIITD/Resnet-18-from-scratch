# Resnet-18-from-scratch
This Repository contains experimentations with CNN network, which can be summerized into 4 tasks.
1. Train a CNN network with ResNet-18 as a backbone from scratch with CIFAR-10 and note down the performance ---> [Code](https://github.com/SarathMohanIITD/Resnet-18-from-scratch/blob/main/1.ipynb)
2. Initialize the ResNet-18 network with pre-trained weights from ImageNet and then tried to use these weights to improve the training for the CIFAR-10 dataset ---> [Code](https://github.com/SarathMohanIITD/Resnet-18-from-scratch/blob/main/2.ipynb)
3. Train the network from scratch with the Tiny-CIFAR-10 dataset and tried data augmentation techniques to improve the performance.

4. Visualize the activations of the CNN for a few test examples in each of the above cases. ---> [Code](https://github.com/SarathMohanIITD/Resnet-18-from-scratch/blob/main/4.ipynb)
