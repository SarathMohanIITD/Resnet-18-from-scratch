# Resnet-18-from-scratch
This Repository contains experimentations with CNN network, which can be summerized into 4 tasks.
1. Train a CNN network with ResNet-18 as a backbone from scratch with CIFAR-10 and note down the performance.
2. Initialize the ResNet-18 network with pre-trained weights from ImageNetand then tried to use these weights to improve the training for the CIFAR-10 dataset
3. Train the network from scratch with the Tiny-CIFAR-10 dataset. Try using as many data augmentation techniques as you can think of to try to improve the performance. Try dropout after different layers and with different dropout
rates.
4. Visualize the activations of the CNN for a few test examples in each of the above cases.
